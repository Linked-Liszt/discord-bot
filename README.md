# Discord Bot

The project began by collecting stats on a discord server with a few close friends.

The primary goals of the project are:
* Create a pipeline to gather, filter, and build language models from data.
* Serve model text generation via a discord bot.
* Various other bot shenanigans.

Currently the bot has the abilities to:
* Generate and serve markov models of individual users
* Serve readability scores of a message from a variety of tests
* Serve sentiment analysis of a message
* Log URL and image content posted in a channel and highlight when content is "reposted"
