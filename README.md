# Discord Stats & Bot

The project began by collecting stats on a discord server with a few close friends.

Using that data, the bot has two main features. 

1. Output markov chains, by user, based off the history of the discord server. Also included a combined model and some fun models.  

2. A RNG "league" which where users could challenge each other to see who had the best luck. Included an elo system to keep track of who was luckiest.
